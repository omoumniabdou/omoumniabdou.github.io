 My professional experience so far has allowed me to have the necessary perspective to know what I want to do in my next job: Become an Engineering Manager.

I had different roles during my career as an individual contributor as a Software/Data Engineering and Optimization Engineer. I also had managing roles as Project Manager and Lead developer where I did appreciate Leading technical teams to achieve their goals and help juniors ramp up and improve their skills.

I enjoy both worlds, contributing technically to projects and managing technical people. This is why an Engineering Manager position seems to be the right career choice for me. A position where I would mainly manage a Software Engineering team by ensuring that everyone's objectives are met and that the team delivers in good condition and good harmony and that each member of the team can grow and progress.

TODO finish this
