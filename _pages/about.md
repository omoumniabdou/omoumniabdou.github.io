Hello reader, my name is Othman Moumni Abdou.
I am currently a Senior Data Engineer at **InUse**, Boulogne-Billancourt, France. My main role at InUse is to build, maintain and scale data pipelines for real time Industrial IoT data. I also work on the rest of the stack such as Monitoring, BackEnd and some FrontEnd from time to time) and help in product design.

I am a Software Engineering leader with 10 years experience in software design, development and implementation mainly on high performant mathematical optimization softwares and real time data ingestion & processing pipelines for IIoT data.
I wore many hats during my career including Senior Software Engineer, Project Manager, Optimization Expert and L3 technical support.

I graduated from **Enseeiht** with an Engineering degree in Computer Science & Applied Mathematics and from **Dauphine/Mines Paris Tech** with a master degree in Optimization and Operation Research.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing basketball, travelling and hanging with my son.
