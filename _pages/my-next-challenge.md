My professional experience so far has allowed me to have the necessary perspective to know what I want to do in my next job: Become an Engineering Manager.

I had different roles during my career as an individual contributor as a Software/Data Engineering and Optimization Engineer. I also had managing roles as Project Manager and Lead developer where I did appreciate Leading technical teams to achieve their goals and help juniors ramp up and improve their skills.

I enjoy both worlds, contributing technically to projects and managing technical people. This is why an Engineering Manager position seems to be the right career choice for me. A position where I would mainly manage a Software Engineering team to ensure successful project deliveries while building an engaged and confident team where each member can grow and progress.
